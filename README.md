## Getting started

You might need to go to docker-deploy/app/ to do "chmod 777 ./scripts/runserver.sh" to give access to the shell script. 

If you cannot run with docker-compose and you are running a gradle with a version of 8.0.2. You can simply cd into the docker-deploy and then cd into the app, and run gradle run to test the server.
